## Instructions
1. Before writing any code, make a list of specs detailing each behavior your program will have. Start with the simplest possible behavior, and slowly move up in complexity.

2. Have at least two other pairs check your specs before you begin coding. Ensure that each possible behavior is represented by a spec, and that they are ordered from simplest to most complex.

3. Place your specs (and their example inputs and outputs) in your project's README.
